# gHeroin
 A heroin manufactoring addon for Garry's Mod.

## This sounds familiar...
That's because this addon was originally made to be published on [gmodstore](https://www.gmodstore.com/), however due to demotivation and schoolwork, I stopped working on it.

## Where is the config?
lua/gheroin/config/sh_config.lua

## Features
- Some (not all) models.
- Full drug system.
- NPC Placement system.
- Adds a new way for players to make money.
- Lightweight.
- Optimised to the full.
- Cool looking 3d2d.
- Extensive config.
- NPC w/ dialog and UI.
- Drag + Drop Installation
- bLogs support.

## Can I contribute?
Sure. Go for it.

## Why didn't you continue with the addon?
Pure demotivation and busy life.

## Thanks!
